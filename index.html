                <p>I've always liked to draw. Following that path, I studied at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and received
                    my BFA in Graphic Design from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. For decades since then, I have
                    been providing Graphic Design solutions for various businesses and organizations. I have a rich body
                    of work, a friendly personality, and a vast knowledge of trivia.</p>
                <p>I live in Minneapolis, have a wife, two kids, a dog and a bird. Plus more extended relatives than I can count.
                    I enjoy fixing things, bicycling, building stuff with my kids, and traveling lakes and woods.</p>
